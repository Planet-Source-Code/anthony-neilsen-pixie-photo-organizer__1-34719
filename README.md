### Description

A complete app which organizes your pictures, with style! Gives you the option to save a copy of your pics in an archive folder and/or in the Pixie database or just show the pics from their original location. You can save pics as JPG to save space or BMP for faster laoding - heaps of features like resize, with bilinear resampling, auto cascade and tiling, etc etc.
